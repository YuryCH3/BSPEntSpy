<h3>Search syntax HELP</h3>
<hr>
<p>The entities can be found by inputting a search-string into the search bar. By default the entity is matched if 
	and only if a <b>classname</b> or <b>targetname</b> is equal to or contains a search-string. </p>
<br>
<p>There is an option to use advanced search, this way it is possible to precisely specify the searched key-values of an entity.</p>
<b>Example:</b>
<p><i>@"targetname" = "zombie1" @"squadname" = "ravenholm_zombies"</i></p>
<p>This search-string is going to match only entities who's targetname is "zombie1" AND squadname parameter is "ravenholm zombies".</p>
