# BSPEntSpy - enhanced Entity Lump editor
BSPEntSpy is an updated version of **EntSpy** originaly made by Rof (http://www.bagthorpe.org/bob/cofrdrbob/).

## Features
* **Importing and exporting** entities
* **Patching from VMF**
* **FGD support** for SmartEdit like editing
* **Mass editing** for editing multiple entities at once (works as in Hammer Editor)
* **Undo / Redo** functionality for time-travelling and fixing mistakes

## Changes compared to the original version
Apart from features listed above the UI has been updated to use system
*Look and Feel*, instead of Java's default, dated and ugly *Metal* theme.  
Other changes include:
* switch from Tree entity display to a flat List
* complete overhaul of entity parameters edit panel (including separate tab for
editing flags)
